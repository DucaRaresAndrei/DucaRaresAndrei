# Hi, I’m Duca Andrei-Rares

I am a 4th-year Computer Science and Engineering student at POLITEHNICA University of Bucharest, ambitious, motivated, and hardworking, with a strong passion for software development and building practical, reliable systems. Through academic and personal projects, I have developed solid programming foundations in C, Java, and Kotlin, along with experience designing backend services and microservice-style architectures, working with databases, and containerizing applications with Docker. I am also comfortable on the frontend side, having built full-stack web applications with Vue and a focus on clean, user-friendly UI/UX.

I work confidently in Linux-based environments (including WSL), and I enjoy learning new technologies quickly and adapting to different tools, workflows, and team dynamics. I am also increasingly interested in applying AI concepts where they add real value, and I am eager to keep expanding in that direction. Volunteering has strengthened my communication and teamwork, helping me collaborate effectively, take ownership, and stay dependable under pressure.
